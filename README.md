Is DEFCON Canceled? (.com)
==========================
No longer do you have to make convincing arguments to mislead the next generation of information security professionals that your beloved conference has been tragically canceled. Our aim is to lend credibility to this ancient farce by putting it on the internet! As we all know, everything on the internet is "true". Buying a domain and publishing content essentially makes you an expert in every subject. As such, we aim to codify this with a useful facade of disinformation.
